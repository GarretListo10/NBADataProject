# NBADataProject
NBA SQL Database - Exploratory Data Analysis Project -- 
Overview -- 
This project showcases my ability to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL. It involves analyzing NBA-related data by applying complex filtering, multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs), grouping CTEs, and using subqueries to extract insights.

Data Description -- 
The dataset includes detailed information about NBA players, teams, games, statistics, and more. However, there are a few data inconsistencies that should be noted:

Missing Data: -- Some teams, such as the Cleveland Cavaliers, have incomplete or missing data.
Inconsistent Naming: Teams like LA Clippers and L.A. Clippers are listed as two separate teams, which may lead to discrepancies in analysis if not addressed.
These inconsistencies can be mitigated through data cleaning and normalization, but for the purpose of this project, they have been left as is to demonstrate how to handle and work with imperfect data.

Key Features of the Analysis -- 
Complex Filtering: I used multiple filtering techniques to refine the dataset, including handling NULL values, using WHERE, IN, LIKE, and more.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): I implemented multiple CTEs to break down the analysis into manageable, reusable parts. These allowed me to simplify complex queries and improve readability.
Grouping of CTEs: In some queries, I grouped data from multiple CTEs to draw comparisons and aggregate statistics across various metrics.
Subqueries: Subqueries were used to extract specific data from nested queries, enabling detailed, granular analysis.


Project Purpose --
The goal of this project is to display my proficiency in SQL techniques, such as filtering, aggregating, and performing advanced operations like joins, CTEs, and subqueries. The focus is on the data exploration and analysis process, particularly in how to manipulate and query a complex sports dataset.

Notes -- 
Potential Issues: Due to the mentioned inconsistencies in the dataset, results might slightly differ depending on how these anomalies are handled.
Data Cleanup: The analysis assumes a direct approach to querying the raw data without extensive preprocessing, as the focus is on SQL querying techniques.
